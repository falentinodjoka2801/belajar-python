myList  =   [
    "one", "two", "three" "four", "five"
]
print(len(myList)) #4

#It returns 4. I've not figured it out how it can be happened. Is it bug or a feature in python, IDK.

name    =   "Falentino" "Djoka"
print(name)

#Now I know the answer
#If you put two or more adjacent strings, it means your strings will be concatenated. For example, variable name above
#consist of two strings "Falentino", and "Djoka". Python automatically concat these string, and the result is "FalentinoDjoka"
